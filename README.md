# TrialsDKnight

Hi!, im Inaudito, this is my first ambitious project who i'm working since July, 2022.
Trials of D. Knight its inspired by so many platformers games, the mechanics of Dark Souls and many features of D&D.
D. Knight its a noun of "Deny" main mechanic of the game.
To be honest, i dont know what history apply to my game, im only developing for fun and improve my skills for a future. So, im gonna work on a history to match with the mechanics and style of Trials of D. Knight.
